   Posted Job Title
  Senior Data Scientist, Crime and Justice Policy Lab (CJP)
 

   Job Profile Title
  Data Analyst Senior
 

   Job Description Summary
  We are hiring a Senior Data Scientist with strong technical skills to work on research projects, primarily in support of the CJP’s project studying illegal gun markets in the US. The Data Scientist will contribute to multiple steps of data collection and cleaning, developing adequate models to analyze data, help in design of research analyses to support elements of the project, analyze outcome and process data, and present findings to project partners and at professional conferences.
 

   Job Description
 

   Job Responsibilities:
 


   This position is working in the Crime and Justice Policy Lab (CJP), a research group within the University of Pennsylvania Department of Criminology. The mission of the CJP Lab is to apply rigorous methods of scientific research to improve public safety in disadvantaged communities, centering those communities in the design and execution of policy ideas, and ensuring that research and government policy is being done with communities rather than to communities. The end goal for our work is that citizens in Philadelphia and other major cities are able to enjoy safety and equitable treatment and outcomes in their day-to-day lives. CJP works primarily in Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, Oakland, and San Francisco, and with several federal government partners and international partners in Latin America and the Caribbean.
 


   CCR projects often pursue a “triple bottom line”—our successful projects are ones that reduce violence that is affecting communities, reduce incarceration, and lessen the burden of policing on communities by generating fewer and more just interactions between police and community members. As many of our projects directly work with the criminal justice system to achieve these goals, we need to be comfortable both holding the priorities of the communities we serve at the center of our work, while also being able to work productively with police and other groups.
 


   One of our major projects was recently featured in a Washington Post op-ed written by the Mayor of Baltimore:
 



    https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/06/baltimore-violence-prevention-pilot-success/
  



   CJP is part the University of Pennsylvania’s Criminology Department, where current faculty are highly regarded as teachers and researchers who represent a range of academic disciplines: psychology, sociology, economics, public policy, law, statistics, and criminology.
 


   Job Responsibilities/Duties:
 


   CJP is a longtime collaborator with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), and is engaged in several active research projects with ATF related to understanding the evolving dynamics around illegal guns and illegal gun sales in the US.
 


   CJP is also supported by major donations to engage in its own research related to illegal gun—research that is informed by but separate from ATF projects. This research includes:
 




     The proliferation of “ghost guns” and privately manufactured firearms and the connections of these firearms to shootings and other violent crimes
   


     The online sources and financing of firearms across the US
   


     The use of social media platforms to sell firearms illegally
   


     Patterns of gun sales and sellers across different US cities, and how those sales could be disrupted to improve community safety
   



   The end goal of the project is developing accessible policy recommendations that could be implemented nationally and in different jurisdictions across the country to reduce illegal firearm trafficking and to stop the most common pathways of guns to criminal groups.
 


   This project involves some of the leading researchers studying how to reduce gun violence in the US.
 


   Compared to other Data Scientists in our research group, the Senior Data Scientist will have greater facility with programming and working with large datasets. Beyond the illegal gun markets project, the Data Scientist may also collaborate with other staff on a portfolio of projects that include conducting original data collection, analyzing extant data, and helping develop research designs and conduct evaluations of new policies. This position requires an individual who is able to work as a part of small research teams running multiple projects concurrently and managing student research assistants. The position offers the opportunity to work directly with leading crime and violence prevention researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and with subject matter experts and practitioner experts from across the US.
 


For consideration, please submit a cover letter as well as a resume in the CV section of your application. You can upload multiple documents to the ""Resume/CV"" section.


   Qualifications:
 


   Bachelor of Science and 4 years of experience or equivalent combination of education and experience is required. Bachelor’s degree in economics, sociology, public policy, statistics, computer science, or a closely related field with substantial training in quantitative methods preferred, Master’s Degree strongly preferred. Experience working with statistical programming languages required (STATA experience strongly preferred).

  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is one of the 12 regional Reserve Banks that, together with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. It helps formulate and implement monetary policy, supervises banks and bank and savings and loan holding companies, and provides financial services to depository institutions and the federal government. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia serves eastern and central Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware.
 
 Job Summary:
 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and its Consumer Finance Institute (CFI) seek a well-trained and motivated Senior Data Scientist (Sr. DS) to lead analytical, machine vision, and machine learning activities for a digitization center (DC) focused on the restoration of economic data.
 
 The digitization center is a collaboration of the CFI and the Bank’s Research Department.
 
 This newly established initiative will facilitate the exploration of a variety of current and historical topics in regional economics and consumer finance. The Sr. DS facilitates this mission by supporting and advising frontier research projects in the use of state-of-the-art technology and machine learning to convert natively unstructured data (information stored in books, images, and other undigitized formats) into ready-to-use digital data.
 
 This position will report to the CFI Senior Manager, Data Science and Engineering.
 

   What You Will Do:
 


   The Sr. DS will digitize historical data sets (Census reports, special Census tabulations, deed books, realty directories and sales transactions logs, maps, etc.) as well as more recent data stored in non-open or unstructured formats (pdfs, print-only reports, earnings calls, interviews, etc.). Most projects will involve tabular or geospatial data, but some will require text to be structured to facilitate ML, search, and econometrics.
 


   The Sr. DS will use modern cloud computing resources, including EMR/Spark, OpenSearch, various commercial ML-as-a-service providers – Hugging Face, Google Vision, and Amazon Textract – and advise senior staff on the use and acquisition of new techniques and services. Sr. DS will also use ML packages such as scikit-learn, scikit-image, OpenCV and TensorFlow to build custom models and techniques.

   This position affords many opportunities to develop knowledge of economics, markets, public policy, and empirical techniques. While this position is within the Consumer Finance Institute, the Sr. DS will have the opportunity to interact with a broad set of researchers and research areas across the Bank.
 


   With sufficient experience and demonstrated skills, and with management approval, the Sr DS may pursue opportunities for co-authorship with a variety of Bank researchers and develop self-directed research projects on related topics.

 An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience.

 As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations.

As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.
