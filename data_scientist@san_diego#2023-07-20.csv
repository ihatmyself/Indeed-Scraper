Seasats is a small but rapidly growing company building autonomous boats for commercial, defense, and ocean science customers. The vehicles we build are strong and durable enough to carry sensors on multi-month ocean missions, but are also light enough to be handled by 1-2 people without cranes or heavy equipment.
The company is located in sunny San Diego, CA and is composed of talented engineers, builders, tinkerers, and business people. Internally, our shop work culture is hard working, but fun and quite flexible. Externally, we've built a reputation for being professional, knowledgeable, and dedicated to getting the job done. For more info, check out seasats.com (https://seasats.com/).
Role: Software and Machine Learning Developer

Salary Range: $90,000-$130,000 + stock options and benefits
Rather than making a highly specific job post asking for x years of experience, we've left this post and its salary range pretty broad. If you apply, we'll see how you would fit into our organization and offer compensation accordingly. Minimal work/project experience will lead to an offer on the lower end; killer experience/credentials will put you on the higher end.

Key Traits/Skills:

Python experience
 OpenCV experience
 Machine learning experience with one or more of the common frameworks
   
 TensorFlow, Keras api, PyTorch

 Fundamental understanding of ML failure modes and statistics
 Have played with ChatGPT :)
 Have run ML experiments in a cloud environment
 Dislike for sitting around while models train
 Experience with autoencoders
 Experience deploying ML models to edge devices (RPis, Jetsons, Odroid, etc.)
 Familiarity with real-time systems and sensors (cameras, lidar, radar, etc.)
 Communication skills, teamwork, and humility
 Ability to independently scope projects and features efficiently
 Knowledge of mobile robotics (nice to have, not required)
   
 Path planning, collision avoidance, control strategies, etc.


The Details:
As a part of our software team in San Diego, you would take the lead on machine learning projects for the company. To set the stage for what you'd be jumping into: we're at an inflection point, increasing the number of vehicles we have at sea and the number of missions we're running. We have a small number (3 – 5) of well scoped ML projects, some of which have been started on (batch experiments) and some of which we have a proxy in place for. All of the projects are high-impact and high-value. A breakdown of day-to-day tasks for the first few months would include:

Improving and refining existing ML pipelines
 Building implementation strategies for new ML projects
 Working with vehicle software dev and operations teams to refine data collection techniques and missions
 Running local and cloud ML experiments
 Communicating test & experiment results to teammates through graphs, key metrics, and functional reports
 Deploying and evaluating models running on vessels that are out on the ocean

This is an excellent opportunity to do high impact work, see your code go into live field robotics applications, and join a fun and hard working team on the cutting edge of ocean autonomy. Whether you're a new grad or a 30 year industry vet, we expect an open-minded learning attitude from everyone at Seasats.
If you join, you'll receive a competitive salary, health insurance, perks, stock options, and an important spot in a rapidly growing ocean tech company. We're extremely committed to helping new team members succeed by ramping up with well-scoped projects and regularly taking the time to discuss where things are working and what needs to change. We're also big on personal freedoms: if you're on top of your responsibilities and want the afternoon off to surf, play with your dog, or do whatever you want to do, go for it! We have flexible hours, a flexible time off schedule, and a personable, kickass work culture. We want someone who's stoked to contribute in and to this environment.


If you apply, we'll ask for the following:

A resume.
 Confirmation that you're in San Diego or willing to relocate here.
   
 Hybrid/flexible work is an option after a 1-3 month ramp up period.

 Link to your GitHub (if you have one).
 1-2 sentences describing the largest software project you've been a part of and your role in it.
 One-sentence or less replies to the following questions:
   
 Describe the goal/objective of a custom ML model you've implemented (it doesn't need to be large, or a success).
 Describe the general architecture of the custom model from your previous example (high level is fine, no layer-by-layer breakdowns necessary).
 Was the design inspired by an existing model?
 Roughly how much data did you train it on?
 Roughly how long did you train it for?



We appreciate diverse perspectives and life experiences and so encourage people of all backgrounds to apply. Note, however, that we are currently unable to sponsor employment visas, so candidates must be independently authorized to work in the United States.
We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
