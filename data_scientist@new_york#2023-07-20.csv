Data Scientist [NYC],CarbonChain,"Hybrid remote in New York, NY",Posted 30+ days ago,,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=d42a40a11d675cc9&fccid=cc9736530099397d&vjs=3,"Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?
 We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future.
 Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.  You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.

 Working at CarbonChain
 To join CarbonChain, you'll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.
 We encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that's developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential.
 What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?
 As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients.
 As the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you'll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market.
 This is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We're looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems.
 You can expect to have:

Ownership of your projects
Extensive client exposure
The ability to make real changes with tangible business value

Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.
 Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.
 Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?

Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond
Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch
Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair
Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.
Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.
PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.
Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).
Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.
Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.
Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.
GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.
Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.
Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.

You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.
 What we require from applicants

Right to work in the US and willingness to come to the NYC office 2+ days a week
4+ years of relevant work experience
A passion for environmental issues
A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers
The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup

What we're offering

Healthcare
Competitive salary + generous equity package
Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing
$2,000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things
Tech equipment of your choice
Regular social activities
Generous amount of holidays, 26 days of annual leave

We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.

 If you think your skills and experience match what we're looking for and you'd like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch!"

However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.
 


 One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.
 


 We


   - come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
 

   - are allergic to over-engineering.
 

   - are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
 

love playing board and video games.


   - are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
 

   - are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
 

   - have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).
 


 As an early member of our data science team, you will help


   - push the limits of what can be done with data.
 

   - build the team and drive the direction of the company.
 

   - shape our product and culture.
 

   - experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.
 


 The following are required


   - the tools: Python, Pandas / Polars, Matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
 

SQL and fundamental database operations.


   - recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
 

fluency in statistics and probability.

"Data Scientist, Product",Notion,"New York, NY",Posted 30+ days ago,"$160,000 - $255,000 a year",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=f37f588b44963160&fccid=7095ffd299c81ef3&vjs=3,"About Us:
 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.  Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
 About The Role:
 Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
 What You'll Achieve:

You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You’ll explore Notion’s data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)

Skills You'll Need to Bring:

You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

Nice to Haves:

You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.

We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
 Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.  Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below.

 Job Description

There is no doubt that banking and financial services represent the most complex data & domain environment in existence today. Due to a lost decade brought on by the financial crisis in 2008, today’s banks are only now beginning their data journey. Over the coming decade, the sector will change inexorably. The challenges of helping achieve this change will be led by an elite group of data experts who start their careers over this period.
 Prospect 33’s Global Data Lab will give you the opportunity to take a deep dive into the full project life cycle and work in this complex domain & data environment to gain real-world experience and critical domain knowledge. This is not your typical training course; this is a real-world project training environment designed to overcome the critical challenge of preparing a group of data scientists with little to no experience within financial services to become the leaders of our industry tomorrow.
 Our program combines our deep domain knowledge with real-world data science solutions in an immersive three-month program. You will still have instructional sessions and mentors to lean on, however, the primary focus will be on a project that is a piece of a larger whole and defined at the time of the cohort’s start.
 You will be working on something that has not yet been done in the industry. We work directly with our clients to find a project that can drive the industry forward and lead to innovation. You won’t have to work on those canned, boring projects like customer churn predictions; this is uncharted territory where you won’t be working on anything that you’d be able to find in another program. Our goal is to show the client what is possible, and through that demonstrate your skills and value to them so that they will hire you to help them realize the full solution in their environment.
 HOW WILL THE GLOBAL DATA LAB ACCELERATE YOUR CAREER?
 ENHANCE YOUR DATA SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE

Gain insider knowledge into a complex industry with intricate data
Use the foundational data science skillset, such as SQL, python, and pandas, to solve problems around AML & KYC
Experience common tools for ETL, data warehousing, and data governance
Practice using different models and feature engineering methods to solve real-world problems

GET REAL PROJECT EXPERIENCE

Plan, lead, and execute large change initiatives in our simulated environment
Strategically implement end-to-end data solutions
Experience real-world model development with our proprietary methodology DaSMoDe(TM)
Take a deep dive into the full project life cycle

ACCELERATE YOUR CAREER

Become a data science expert in the most complex data and heavily regulated environment
Mentored by industry leaders and subject matter experts
Boost your resume with valuable project experience and a client-led project that will demonstrate your knowledge of the financial services

HOW DOES THE PROGRAM WORK?
 The program will consist of approximately 13 weeks during which you will have learning sessions alongside project work. The project work will be done in an agile manner, specifically leveraging scrum. You will explore the financial services industry as a whole and learn about the ongoing data initiatives in major financial institutions. You will research and present on multiple topics as well as gain insider knowledge into this complex industry and its intricate data environment. You will plan, lead, and execute a large change program. You will also work with your peers and mentors to build a viable proof of concept (POC) for machine learning software to solve issues that our clients are facing right now.


Job Requirements

A master’s degree in Data Science, Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Business Analytics, Computer Science, or other related fields OR an equivalent combination of education and experience or other credible Data Science Bootcamps
If not in a program that is specifically related to data science then you must have significant data science project experience and/or 2 years of relevant work experience
Must be strongly capable with SQL & Python (and relevant libraries)
Time to dedicate to the program (roughly 10-15 hours per week)

 Job Description

There is no doubt that banking and financial services represent the most complex data & domain environment in existence today. Due to a lost decade brought on by the financial crisis in 2008, today’s banks are only now beginning their data journey. Over the coming decade, the sector will change inexorably. The challenges of helping achieve this change will be led by an elite group of data experts who start their careers over this period.
 Prospect 33’s Global Data Lab will give you the opportunity to take a deep dive into the full project life cycle and work in this complex domain & data environment to gain real-world experience and critical domain knowledge. This is not your typical training course; this is a real-world project training environment designed to overcome the critical challenge of preparing a group of data scientists with little to no experience within financial services to become the leaders of our industry tomorrow.
 Our program combines our deep domain knowledge with real-world data science solutions in an immersive three-month program. You will still have instructional sessions and mentors to lean on, however, the primary focus will be on a project that is a piece of a larger whole and defined at the time of the cohort’s start.
 You will be working on something that has not yet been done in the industry. We work directly with our clients to find a project that can drive the industry forward and lead to innovation. You won’t have to work on those canned, boring projects like customer churn predictions; this is uncharted territory where you won’t be working on anything that you’d be able to find in another program. Our goal is to show the client what is possible, and through that demonstrate your skills and value to them so that they will hire you to help them realize the full solution in their environment.
 HOW WILL THE GLOBAL DATA LAB ACCELERATE YOUR CAREER?

GET REAL PROJECT EXPERIENCE

Plan, lead, and execute large change initiatives in our simulated environment
Strategically implement end-to-end data solutions
Experience real-world model development with our proprietary methodology DaSMoDe(TM)
Take a deep dive into the full project life cycle

ACCELERATE YOUR CAREER

Become a data science expert in the most complex data and heavily regulated environment
Mentored by industry leaders and subject matter experts
Boost your resume with valuable project experience and a client-led project that will demonstrate your knowledge of the financial services

HOW DOES THE PROGRAM WORK?
 The program will consist of approximately 13 weeks during which you will have learning sessions alongside project work. The project work will be done in an agile manner, specifically leveraging scrum. You will explore the financial services industry as a whole and learn about the ongoing data initiatives in major financial institutions. You will research and present on multiple topics as well as gain insider knowledge into this complex industry and its intricate data environment. You will plan, lead, and execute a large change program. You will also work with your peers and mentors to build a viable proof of concept (POC) for machine learning software to solve issues that our clients are facing right now.


Job Requirements

A master’s degree in Data Science, Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Business Analytics, Computer Science, or other related fields OR an equivalent combination of education and experience or other credible Data Science Bootcamps
If not in a program that is specifically related to data science then you must have significant data science project experience and/or 2 years of relevant work experience
Must be strongly capable with SQL & Python (and relevant libraries)
Time to dedicate to the program (roughly 10-15 hours per week)

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
 About The Role
 We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product in a high quality way. You’ll be exploring the boundaries of what’s possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion’s offering.
 What You'll Achieve:

Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver product features on time
Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends

Skills You'll Need to Bring:

Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 6+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You’re excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.

Nice to Haves:

You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.

We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Machine Learning Engineer,OXMAN,"New York, NY 10005 (Financial District area)",Posted 30+ days ago,"$83,000 - $225,000 a year",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=adb341d491c3c741&fccid=43e8b1c3e0c763d0&vjs=3,"OXMAN
 


 OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.
 


 At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.
 


 We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.
 


 This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.
 


 Summary
 


 OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.
 


 The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.
 


 Core responsibilities

 Lead efforts to aggregate and maintain selected multimodal datasets
 Apply techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop, implement, and evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms for applications related to biology, sustainability, and environmental data
 Develop machine learning models and detailed documentation to assess system performance
 Develop scalable rules-based systems, classifiers, regressors, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning systems, and other machine learning pipelines to support physical and digital projects within our organization
 Conduct functional analysis, design trade studies, requirements allocation, and interface definition to translate team and client requirements into hardware and software specifications
 Actively seek opportunities to publish work in top-tier journals and other platforms for diffusing scientific knowledge
 Nurture and augment the scientific vision of OXMAN, upholding core design principles and ensuring the highest and most innovative quality of work
 Actively partner with a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including other biologists, engineers, and designers, across scientific and design pursuits
 Communicate ideas, work, and progress clearly, including by engaging in team meetings, presentations, and other creative communication outlets

 Qualifications & competencies

 PhD or equivalent, with a focus on computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, applied data science, bioinformatics, mathematics, physics, or relevant field
 Minimum 4 years of experience with machine learning
 Portfolio demonstrating out-of-the-box thinking and stellar taste in design
 Fluency with programming (e.g., MATLAB, Python, Java, C++)
 Ability to thrive in a fast-paced entrepreneurial environment
 Excellent independence, self-motivation, organizational skills, and attention to detail
 An interest in design, biology, architecture, artificial intelligence, and/or sustainability is a plus
 Strong commitment to the team; maintains positive working relationships with diverse people, including internal team and external partners
 Embodies ethics and integrity in all work, respecting both company and broader community policies in all conduct

You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives.

Machine Learning Engineer,OXMAN,"New York, NY 10005 (Financial District area)",Posted 30+ days ago,"$83,000 - $225,000 a year",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=adb341d491c3c741&fccid=43e8b1c3e0c763d0&vjs=3,"OXMAN
 


 OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.
 


 At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.
 


 We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.
 


 This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.
 


 Summary
 


 OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.
 


 The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.
 


 Core responsibilities

 Lead efforts to aggregate and maintain selected multimodal datasets
 Apply techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop, implement, and evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms for applications related to biology, sustainability, and environmental data
 Develop machine learning models and detailed documentation to assess system performance
 Develop scalable rules-based systems, classifiers, regressors, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning systems, and other machine learning pipelines to support physical and digital projects within our organization
 Conduct functional analysis, design trade studies, requirements allocation, and interface definition to translate team and client requirements into hardware and software specifications
 Actively seek opportunities to publish work in top-tier journals and other platforms for diffusing scientific knowledge
 Nurture and augment the scientific vision of OXMAN, upholding core design principles and ensuring the highest and most innovative quality of work
 Actively partner with a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including other biologists, engineers, and designers, across scientific and design pursuits
 Communicate ideas, work, and progress clearly, including by engaging in team meetings, presentations, and other creative communication outlets

 Qualifications & competencies

 PhD or equivalent, with a focus on computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, applied data science, bioinformatics, mathematics, physics, or relevant field
 Minimum 4 years of experience with machine learning
 Portfolio demonstrating out-of-the-box thinking and stellar taste in design
 Fluency with programming (e.g., MATLAB, Python, Java, C++)
 Ability to thrive in a fast-paced entrepreneurial environment
 Excellent independence, self-motivation, organizational skills, and attention to detail
 An interest in design, biology, architecture, artificial intelligence, and/or sustainability is a plus
 Strong commitment to the team; maintains positive working relationships with diverse people, including internal team and external partners
 Embodies ethics and integrity in all work, respecting both company and broader community policies in all conduct


   OXMAN does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or any other legally protected characteristics.

 About Us:
 Cityblock Health is the first tech-driven provider for communities with complex needs—bringing better care to where it's needed most, block by block. Founded in 2017 on the premise that ""health is local"" and based in Brooklyn, we are backed by Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs along with some of the top healthcare investors in the country.
 Our mission is to improve the health of underserved communities. Importantly, our solutions are designed specifically for Medicaid and lower-income Medicare beneficiaries, and we meet our members where they are, bringing care into the home and neighborhoods through our community-based care teams and Virtual Care offerings.
 In close collaboration with community-based organizations, local providers, and leading health plans, we are reorganizing the health system to focus on what matters to our members. Equipped with world-class, custom care delivery technology, we deliver personalized primary care, behavioral health, and social services to deliver a radically better experience of care for every member and community we serve.
 Over the next year, we'll grow quickly to bring better care to many more members and their communities. To do this, we need people who, like us, believe that everyone should have good care for what matters to them, in their community.
 Our work is grounded in a belief in the power of a diverse community. To close gaps in care and advance equity in the communities we serve, we have to start with making our own team diverse and inclusive. Our ways of working are characterized by creativity, collaboration, and mutual learning that comes from bringing together a community from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We strive to ensure that every person on the Cityblock team, and every Cityblock member, feels supported and included as a part of our community.
