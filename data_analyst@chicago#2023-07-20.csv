 Mastermind TMS allows our customers to bring all of these functions into a single platform, providing flexibility, visibility, control, and efficiency. Today’s unprecedented global supply chain upheavals underscore how important the transportation industry is. We are building a system to allow this industry to work faster, smarter and more efficiently.

Strategy & Business Modeling Business Analyst,BTS,"Hybrid remote in Chicago, IL 60606",Posted 30+ days ago,,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=6a7c6e1a97c84308&fccid=bff0100e9ce77399&vjs=3,"What You’ll Do at BTS
The greatest ideas in the world will die on the vine if not properly implemented. At BTS, we turn our clients’ ideas and strategies into results. We do this by designing customized experiences that drive innovation, alignment, and performance.
As a Business Analyst consultant on the Strategy & Business Modeling team, you’ll work directly with leaders from the world’s leading corporations. You’ll learn their strategies and how their businesses work, and you’ll be shaping the leadership capabilities of their senior management. A BTS consultant also cultivates the skills of thousands of developing leaders across the globe.
A Strategy & Business Modeler (SBMer) is responsible for designing and building the business simulations and models that are the foundation of many BTS experiences. Our excel-based models help leaders at organizations visualize their role in their company’s strategy and understand how their decisions impact organizational performance.
The SBMer is a key member of the BTS consultant team that conducts discovery interviews with client stakeholders, co-creates a design with the client to deliver on their objectives, builds the modeling component of the experience, and delivers, facilitates, and presents the end solution to the client. An SBMer brings specialized knowledge to the BTS team by helping to simplify complex business models, highlighting tradeoffs within the client’s business, and bringing strong business and financial expertise to the team. The SBMer is also expected to be a trusted advisor to the client by co-leading interviews and milestone meetings as well as joining client facilitation teams. ,
There are no industry verticals at BTS, and you will have all the variety you want in your clients and work. You’ll be staffed on multiple projects at one time, across different industries, and with different internal teams.
We feel that regularly working together in the office is the best situation for career development, and so we are not hiring remotely-based employees at this time. However, we have a hybrid work environment where you can work from home a few days a week. As for travel, we do that when we are in front of our clients leading them through BTS experiences and workshops we’ve created. And as we continue getting back to “normal,” you can expect that you’ll travel around 25-30% of the time, going to different cities to facilitate the incredible experiences you’ve designed.

What We’re Looking For
Curiosity. Resourcefulness. A humble and inclusive spirit. These are core attributes of BTS all-stars.
Strong business and financial acumen and a love for problem solving with a structured approach to scoping solutions to those problems. Advanced Excel skills (INDEX/MATCH, Lookups, IF statements) are a must. Modeling skills, as well as experience with programming languages, especially VBA, are big pluses. Backgrounds in engineering, finance, science, math, or economics are well-suited. We have team members from all kinds of backgrounds, work experience, and education. We love diversity and variety.
We do have a few requirements. Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience is needed, as are strong written and verbal communication skills. Willingness to travel as indicated above.
Lastly, we require eligibility to work in the US permanently without sponsorship.
