 New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.

 Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.

 JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL's science and engineering organizations and Caltech's academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines' languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity's core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions' results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration's challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.

 Researchers at the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem group at JPL, and international partners have recently designed a global Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) based on the power of big data from space technology and artificial intelligence (AI) for climate smart forest restoration and carbon management. CMS is focused on providing precise science-based geospatial data products on carbon stocks and annual emissions and removals at the national and jurisdictional levels to empower decision makers for climate mitigation policies. In its initial phase, our team will integrate a series of optical and microwave satellite (including upcoming NISAR and BIOMASS) imagery with airborne and satellite (GEDI, ICESAT-2) lidar measurements of forest structure and conventional ground-based forest inventory data to map and monitor changes of forest structure and biomass globally and attribute the changes to land use activities and environmental effects.

 The selected candidates will work with a team of scientists to conduct original research by using machine learning algorithms and process-based models to develop regional and global products and improve our understanding of drivers of carbon stock changes across a variety of ecosystems.
 The selected candidates may work on two distinct tasks: 1. to map forest disturbance (land use, logging, and tree mortality), fire fuel loads, and biomass carbon change across temperate forests (e.g. western US), and 2. to quantify biomass loss and gain from land use activities (deforestation, degradation), and forest regeneration (e.g. secondary forests) in humid tropical ecosystems (e.g. Amazon and Congo Basins). These tasks will help improve the quantification of global carbon cycle as a result of human and climate-induced changes and better understand the short-term and long-term responses of ecosystems to climate change. The candidates are required to lead one task, perform the analysis, document all algorithms and codes developed for data processing, analysis, science product generation, and lead peer-reviewed publications.

 The candidates must have a PhD in one of the following areas: remote sensing, computer science, environmental science and engineering, mathematics/statistics with relevant experience in forest ecology and geography. Required qualifications include experience in quantitative analysis of geospatial data, machine learning algorithms, and time series analysis. Candidates with relatively advanced knowledge of lidar and radar remote sensing techniques and particularly in forest applications are preferred. Successful candidates must also have strong programming skills in a scientific languages (e.g. python, MATHLAB, R) and experience in statistical analysis. Applicants should have demonstrated quantitative and computational skills, a successful publication record, and the ability to work in an interdisciplinary research environment.

 The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.

 Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.

 JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique. This includes a variety of health, dental, vision, wellbeing, and retirement plans, paid time off, learning, rideshare, childcare, flexible schedule, parental leave and many more. Our focus is on work-life balance, and living healthy, fulfilling lives as we Dare Mighty Things Together.

 New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.

 Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.

 JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL's science and engineering organizations and Caltech's academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines' languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity's core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions' results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration's challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.

 Researchers at the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem group at JPL, and international partners have recently designed a global Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) based on the power of big data from space technology and artificial intelligence (AI) for climate smart forest restoration and carbon management. CMS is focused on providing precise science-based geospatial data products on carbon stocks and annual emissions and removals at the national and jurisdictional levels to empower decision makers for climate mitigation policies. In its initial phase, our team will integrate a series of optical and microwave satellite (including upcoming NISAR and BIOMASS) imagery with airborne and satellite (GEDI, ICESAT-2) lidar measurements of forest structure and conventional ground-based forest inventory data to map and monitor changes of forest structure and biomass globally and attribute the changes to land use activities and environmental effects.

 The selected candidates will work with a team of scientists to conduct original research by using machine learning algorithms and process-based models to develop regional and global products and improve our understanding of drivers of carbon stock changes across a variety of ecosystems.
 The selected candidates may work on two distinct tasks: 1. to map forest disturbance (land use, logging, and tree mortality), fire fuel loads, and biomass carbon change across temperate forests (e.g. western US), and 2. to quantify biomass loss and gain from land use activities (deforestation, degradation), and forest regeneration (e.g. secondary forests) in humid tropical ecosystems (e.g. Amazon and Congo Basins). These tasks will help improve the quantification of global carbon cycle as a result of human and climate-induced changes and better understand the short-term and long-term responses of ecosystems to climate change. The candidates are required to lead one task, perform the analysis, document all algorithms and codes developed for data processing, analysis, science product generation, and lead peer-reviewed publications.

 The candidates must have a PhD in one of the following areas: remote sensing, computer science, environmental science and engineering, mathematics/statistics with relevant experience in forest ecology and geography. Required qualifications include experience in quantitative analysis of geospatial data, machine learning algorithms, and time series analysis. Candidates with relatively advanced knowledge of lidar and radar remote sensing techniques and particularly in forest applications are preferred. Successful candidates must also have strong programming skills in a scientific languages (e.g. python, MATHLAB, R) and experience in statistical analysis. Applicants should have demonstrated quantitative and computational skills, a successful publication record, and the ability to work in an interdisciplinary research environment.

 The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.

 Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.

Description


Planetary missions have returned enormous amounts of surface imagery during the past decades of space exploration, most of which remains unused by planetary scientists due to the inability to manually, exhaustively search for even a single scientifically relevant target feature. This has significant, negative impact on planetary science understanding, surface characterization, and models of active surface processes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to collaboratively focus researchers on candidate regions of interest that otherwise would be obscured by sheer dataset scale, significantly improving extracted science yield and accelerating science discovery in a manner broadly applicable to many planetary bodies.
 This project seeks to combine traditional planetary science and recent advances in computer science to maximize the science return of past space exploration missions.  The candidate will explore cutting edge AI/ML methods to automate science discovery and focus of attention in planetary image datasets. The science targets selected for discovery should be motivated by current, relevant questions that advance our understanding of planet surface dynamics and evolution.
 Candidates that are facile with computationally efficient, rigorous machine learning for image region identification, demonstrate an understanding of both planetary and scalable computer science, and have publication experience in the planetary science literature will be more suitable for this research opportunity. Additional benefit would be provided by past experience with planetary image datasets, data science tools, Geographic Information Software, as well as an established network of expert contacts within planetary and computer science.

Description


Description:
Current and future cosmology missions in the big data era of astronomy can greatly benefit from advances in deep learning. Architectures based on convolutional neural networks (e.g., GANs, deep image prior, diffusion probabilistic models) are well tested for applications such as image generation, data/image to image translation, feature/domain transfer, or super resolution. These applications could notably enhance astronomical measurements from combined data sets. For instance, images boosted in depth and/or resolution can be used to increase the number of usable sources for weak lensing, reduce the systematics errors due to blending, photometric redshifts, and shape measurements, and potentially put tighter constraints on the cosmological parameters measurable through weak lensing. Data from the current ground- and space-based surveys (with e.g., HSC, KiDS+Viking, DES, HST) will be used to quantify the gain for the upcoming missions (i.e., Rubin, Euclid, Roman, and SPherex) with heavy JPL, Caltech and IPAC contributions. We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to lead this effort. Experience with deep learning frameworks is highly desirable, and familiarity with multi-band spectro/photometric galaxy data of existing and future cosmology missions as well as a broad knowledge of weak lensing systematics is preferred. The successful candidate will be working closely with Dr. Eric Huff and Dr. Shoubaneh Hemmati and other members of the cosmology team at JPL.
