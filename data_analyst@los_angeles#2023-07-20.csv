 Peggy is reenvisioning the art market by establishing Art 2.0. Our mission at Peggy is to support the livelihoods of artists. Why? Because artists are the ultimate observers of society with messages to share that create change. What does this mission look like in the world? A world with art in every home. A world where liquidity in the art market is accessible to middle-market collectors. A world where collectors support artists and their observations of the world, the messages they have to share, and the change they create. Peggy creates new opportunities within the art market by making investment-grade art accessible, filling the untapped gap of resale activity in the middle market and shifting benefits to artists by enabling resale royalties.

 Being on the frontier takes visionary thinking, a flexible mindset and the ability to thrive in unchartered land. We value security, storytelling, straightforwardness and forward-thinking. Peggy is the place for you if you’re seeking personal and professional growth and to establish a new way of doing business in the art market.

 As a seed-stage startup, Peggy does not offer a rigid corporate structure. If you crave the structure, clarity and predictability of traditional corporate environments, Peggy might not be a place where you’ll thrive. We operate in an ambiguous environment by being curious, placing bets, shipping fast and learning from the outcomes. We are light on processes at Peggy, instead favouring relationships of high trust achieved through high impact. At our stage, exceptional competencies centre around leading, owning and prioritizing work that achieves business strategies.
 Motivations that excel at Peggy

 Caring deeply about what you do and about establishing Art 2.0
 Being a visionary, experimenting and moving quickly
 Being resilient and resourceful in the face of ambiguity and thriving on (rather than enduring) change
 Embracing disagreements and committing to moving forward despite a difference in opinion


 Mission
 As Data Analyst, your mission is to collect, interpret, and visualize data to support decision-making processes across Peggy. Your insights and recommendations will contribute to driving growth and improving the Peggy marketplace.

 Responsibilities

 Analyze large datasets related to demand-side and supply-side behaviour to address strategic and operational questions.
 Develop and maintain automated dashboards and reports that provide company-wide visibility of key business metrics.

 Design and manage A/B tests, from concept to analysis, to measure the impact of various initiatives.
 Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, including Product, Marketing and Supply to drive data-informed decision-making.
 Transform raw, unstructured data into clean, structured datasets using Snowflake, PopSQL, Mixpanel and Segment.
 Recommend new Segment Events that need measuring, to analyze Peggy’s efficacy towards achieving its business coals
 Analyze business goals of AARRR funnel metrics
 Analyze and quantify k-factor growth loops (e.g. artists refer galleries who refer artists who refer collectors who refer artists)
 Analyze LTV:CAC ratio, MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio), RoAS (Return on Ad Spend)
 Provide actionable insights and recommendations to internal stakeholders for improving products, increasing revenue, and enhancing user retention.
 Generate and present regular reports and dashboards to monitor key metrics and performance indicators.
 Assist other team members in creation and presentation of their dashboards.

 Qualifications

 Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as computer science, mathematics, economics, or related disciplines.
 1-3 years of experience in data analytics.
 Proficiency in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.
 Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to translate complex data into meaningful insights and recommendations.

 Familiarity with cloud data warehouses and ETL processes, such as Snowflake and Python.
 Advanced knowledge of Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.
 Excellent communication skills, with the ability to present complex data findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
 Ability to identify, distill, and synthesize headline insights, and present via data visualizations and key takeaways on slides (e.g. “PowerPoint” - we currently use Figma for slide decks at Peggy)

 About 
beatBread




The Concept


   beatBread is a technology driven platform that enables funding for artists, labels, composers, and other key music industry participants. Creators always have the option to retain long-run ownership of their Music when they seek funding from beatBread, and receive transparent, flexible funding options. Instead of listening to each artist's Music and guessing whether they will grow or not, we feed streaming and fan-engagement data to an optimized machine-learning model to predict artist growth and revenue. We use these predictions to invest in artists, and, also, to empower music companies, institutions, and high net worth individuals to make their own investments in artists. Investors include leading venture capital firms, including Deciens Capital, Mucker Capital and Afore Capital, along with several progressive and innovative music companies.
 


 Why Artists Love What We Do


   Artist’s love beatBread because they can fund their careers without giving up ownership of their Music or the choice of their partners. beatBread's approach also enables us to fund creative people and organizations from those that are ""chart toppers"" to those who are too small or too ""off center"" for traditional labels to back.
 

   Because we don't tell artists which marketing, distribution, or creative partners they need to work with, even large, chart-topping artists often find the options we provide more attractive than traditional funding options.
 


 Company Growth


   Since funding our first artist two years ago, we are now funding more than a deal per day and putting seven figures of advance dollars out in the market each month. Prominent artist service companies have chosen to integrate our platform directly into their products, with major streaming platforms and distributors showing keen interest in partnership. We have also recently announced a $100M artist funding facility, but will be engaging additional funding sources, including institutional investors and banks, in 2023.
 


 Our Team and Culture


   beatBread is a lucky combination of music business executives with decades of experience, startup folks who love music, data scientists who live to dig into billions of data points, and software developers born to build cool stuff. We are all unified by a mission to help more musicians stay independent and keep control of their work and their careers, and a vision to become the largest source of funding in the global music industry.
 

 Culturally, we are curious, hardworking, and informal. As a matter of both pragmatism and personal values, we do our best to approach our work and our partners with more humility than many fast growing venture-backed companies, or many entertainment professionals who put image and status ahead of impact and value."

 Miso Robotics is transforming the food industry, and making lives better.

 Miso is a well known first-mover in kitchen automation, AI, and robotics.
