 What You'll Do as a Senior Data Scientist
 Despite having been fundamentally altered by earlier industrial revolutions, the construction industry has hardly budged with the computer revolution. In fact, since 1970, labor productivity in the US construction industry has actually declined, despite it more than doubling in the rest of the economy. This has contributed to housing shortages and the parlous state of infrastructure in some places, and is sanding the gears of carbon reduction efforts.
 We think the industry is ripe for change, and we're pushing the leading edge of that change with our next generation T3 Platform, the OS for Construction. Through T3, we help contractors to coordinate humans and (increasingly smarter) machines to build more effectively.
 As a Senior Data Scientist in our small and quickly growing team, you will play a major role in this effort. In particular, you will

Drive ongoing projects using a variety of ML, OR and statistical techniques in a full-stack data science environment
