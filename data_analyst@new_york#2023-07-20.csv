"Data Analyst, Securitizations",dv01,"Remote in New York, NY 10010",Posted 30+ days ago,,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=c1f9c44fc48a85b7&fccid=54983fa1b37dd1bb&vjs=3,"dv01 is lifting the curtain on the largest financial market in the world: structured finance. The $16+ trillion market is the backbone of everyday activities that empower financial freedom, from consolidating credit card debt and refinancing student loans, to buying a home and starting a small business.
 dv01's data analytics platform brings unparalleled transparency into investment performance and risk for lenders and Wall Street investors in structured products. As a data-first company, we wrangle critical loan data and build modern analytical tools that enable strategic decision-making for responsible lending. In a nutshell, we're helping prevent a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis by offering the data and tools required to make smarter data-driven decisions resulting in a safer world for all of us.
 More than 400 of the largest financial institutions use dv01 for our coverage of over 75 million loans spanning mortgages, personal loans, auto, buy-now-pay-later programs, small business, and student loans. dv01 continues to expand coverage of new markets, adding loans monthly, and developing new technologies for the structured products universe.
 To get a better idea of what a year at dv01 looks like, check out our 2022 Year in Review page here: https://dv01.co/year-in-review/2022/ If that looks like fun to you, get in touch because we'd love to hear from you.
 You Will:

Be on the cutting edge of structured finance and technology. You will be a critical piece in dv01's robust expansion into the capital markets and structured finance space, combining your knowledge with our state-of-the-art technologies.
Expand your structured finance knowledge. You will gain exposure to many facets of the ABS and RMBS spaces, combining information from a variety of sources (loan-level transaction data, deal documents, trustee reporting, etc.) that all flow into dv01's wide range of client offerings.
Enhance your technical skills. You will work closely with engineering teams at dv01 to develop and productize solutions, both for our customers and internally. If you're not already aware of the world that exists outside of Excel for data analysis, you'll become familiar with it very quickly.
Be customer facing. You will directly communicate with contacts at hedge funds, banks, and asset originators, providing valuable reporting and analytics services to assist with their internal processes.

You Are:

Knowledgeable with financial concepts and data. You have experience working with financial data. Experience working with loan-level servicing data and securitizations is preferable, but not required.
Unafraid of large datasets. You are proficient with Excel. You are comfortable either knowing or learning R to perform ad-hoc data analysis, with a desire and ability to grow quickly on the technical front.
Able to separate the financial wheat from the chaff. You are able to identify key metrics and transactional details on financial statements, investor reports, and securitization trustee reports and are not afraid to get your hands dirty by diving into loan-level data.
A focused, detail-oriented, multi-tasker. You love the intricate details of a thorough analysis, but also stay aware of the bigger picture while operating across multiple threads of work. You're able to communicate your findings and opinions internally, as well as with clients.

In good faith our salary range for this role is $75,000 - $80,000 but are not tied to it. Final offer amount will be at the company's sole discretion and determined by multiple factors, including years and depth of experience, expertise, and other business considerations.
 Our community is fueled by diverse people who welcome differing points of view and the opportunity to learn from each other. Our team is passionate about building a product people love and a culture where everyone can innovate and thrive.
 BENEFITS & PERKS:

Unlimited PTO. Unplug and rejuvenate, however you want—whether that's vacationing on the beach or at home on a mental-health day.
In-House Personal & Performance Development Coach. Recharge with our in-house personal & performance development coach, who is here to listen and help guide in your self-development and overall wellness.
$1,000 Learning & Development Fund. No matter where you are in your career, always invest in your future. We encourage you to attend conferences, take classes, and lead workshops. We also host hackathons, brunch & learns, and other employee-led learning opportunities.
Remote-First Environment. People thrive in a flexible and supportive environment that best invigorates them. You can work from your home, cafe, or hotel. You decide.
Health Care and Financial Planning. We offer a comprehensive medical, dental, and vision insurance package for you and your family. We also offer a 401(k) for you to contribute.
Free Equinox Membership or $1,650 Annual Fitness Fund. Regular exercise offers a plethora of mental and physical health benefits. You can either enroll in an all-access Equinox membership or at your preferred gym. Or take advantage of our fitness fund, which can be used toward at-home workout equipment (yes, including a Peloton).
New Family Bonding. Primary caregivers can take 12 weeks off 100% paid leave, while secondary caregivers can take 3 weeks. Returning to work after bringing home a new child isn't easy, which is why we're flexible and empathetic to the needs of new parents.

"Data Analyst, Bureau of Immunization",NYC DEPT OF HEALTH/MENTAL HYGIENE,"Queens, NY 11101",PostedToday,"$75,504 - $86,830 a year",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=29fa057a1efbe83c&fccid=7d7b563c6a3a9653&vjs=3,"Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live. 
     
 As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises — from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic — we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others. 
     
 Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are: 
      1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods 
      3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness 
      4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health 
      5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change 
     
 Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live. 
     
 As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises — from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic — we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others. 
     
 Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are: 
      1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods 
      3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness 
      4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health 
      5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change 
     
 Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.
